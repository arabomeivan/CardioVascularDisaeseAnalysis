# 🩺 Chronic Disease Monitoring with NHANES

This project applies data visualization techniques to monitor chronic diseases using metadata extracted from the **National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES)**. It focuses on identifying key health indicators associated with **cardiovascular risk**, including diabetes, hypertension, and obesity.

## 📌 Objectives

- Analyze NHANES metadata for chronic disease insights
- Perform preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Python
- Create interactive visualizations with Matplotlib and Seaborn
- Promote timely, data-driven health interventions

## 📊 Tools and Technologies

- **Python**: Data analysis and transformation
- **Pandas & NumPy**: Preprocessing and wrangling
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Visualization and storytelling
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive analysis and documentation

## 🌍 Public Health Context

Chronic diseases are a leading cause of long-term illness and premature death globally. They impose a substantial burden on healthcare systems such as the NHS and affect economic productivity. This project aims to inform **digital health strategies and telehealth solutions** through the power of data.

## 💡 Highlights

- Extraction and analysis of metadata from NHANES
- Visualization of relationships between biomarkers and disease prevalence
- Ethical considerations in public health data use
- Insights tailored to preventive care and early diagnosis

## 🧠 Future Directions

- Integrate dashboard interactivity for real-time health tracking
- Expand analysis to include other NHANES cycles or demographic filters
- Explore ML classifiers for risk prediction


## 🤝 Contributions

This work reflects a multidisciplinary approach—blending **data science**, **public health**, and **design thinking**. Contributions are welcome, especially around data preprocessing strategies, statistical validation, or visualization enhancements.
